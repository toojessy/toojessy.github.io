# Task
    - Your task is to create a detailed flowchart that describes this guessing game. 
    - You will use Mermaid syntax to illustrate this flowchart in a GitHub markdown (.md) file. 
    - Your flowchart should comprehensively cover all logical components of the game that need to be tested.

### Start: The game begins, initializing necessary variables.
### Generate Random Number: The program randomly selects a number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
### Ask User for a Guess: The user is prompted to input their guess for the generated number.
### Input Validation: The program checks if the user input is valid:
### Yes: If the input is valid (e.g., numeric and within range), the program proceeds to check the guess.
### No: If the input is invalid (e.g., non-numeric or out of range), the program displays "Invalid Input" and prompts the user to guess again.
### Check Guess: The program compares the userâ€™s guess to the randomly generated number:
### Correct: If the guess matches the number, the program displays "Correct! You guessed it!" and ends the game.
### Too High: If the guess is higher than the number, the program displays "Too High! Try again." and prompts for another guess.
### Too Low: If the guess is lower than the number, the program displays "Too Low! Try again." and prompts for another guess.
### End: The game concludes, potentially allowing the user to play again or exit.
